1.  A(n) constructor	is used in C++ to guarantee the initialization of a class instance.

2.  A constructor has the same name as the class itself.

3.  Member functions are sometimes called method in other object-oriented languages.

4.  A(n) destructor is a member function that is automatically called to destroy an object.

5.  To access a particular member function,  the code must list the object name and the name  of the function separated from each other by a dot operator.

6.  A default	constructor has no parameters.

7.  A ~ (tild symbol)	precedes the destructor name in the declaration.

8.  A(n) static member function has its implementation given in the class declaration.

9.  In an array of objects,  if the default constructor is invoked, then it is applied to all the	object in the array.

10. A constructor is a member function that is automatically invoked whenever a class  instance is created.
